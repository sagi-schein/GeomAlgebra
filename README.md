# geom_algebra
## library goal
the main goal of this library is to impleemnt a library for handling k-vectors and k-forms. the first implementation is going to be in python to test the design then a port to Rust is going to be created.
## api
1. add(kv1:kv,kv2:kv)->kv
2. exprod(kv1:kv,kv2:kv)->kv
2. norm(kv1:kv)->float

## data structures
kv - k-vector is the basic object that is manipulated
## acceleration
